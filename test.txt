Test fivebar library

Import:

	>>> from fivebar import *

Point class:

	>>> p = Point(3,4)
	>>> print(p)
	point(3,4)

Circle class:

	>>> c = Circle(Point(5,-1), 8)
	>>> print(c)
	circle(point(5,-1),8)

Circle class, three return tuple lengths:

	>>> a = Circle(Point(1,0),1)
	>>> b = Circle(Point(3,0),1)
	>>> c = Circle(Point(2.9,0),1)
	>>> d = Circle(Point(3.1,0),1)
	>>> r1 = a.intersect(b)
	>>> r2 = a.intersect(c)
	>>> r3 = a.intersect(d)
	>>> for i in r1: print(i)
	... 
	point(2.0,0.0)
	>>> len(r1)
	1
	>>> for i in r2: print(i)
	... 
	point(1.95...,-0.31...)
	point(1.95...,0.31...)
	>>> len(r2)
	2
	>>> for i in r3: print(i)
	... 
	>>> len(r3)
	0
	>>>
